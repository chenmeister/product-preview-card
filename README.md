## My process

### Built with

- HTML5/CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned how to utilize flexbox and use the chrome developer tools to test out what CSS syntax is needed to set up `display: flex;`. Also, this is the first project where I utilized the mobile first approach. Overall, utilizing the mobile first approach not only makes my CSS code efficient but also organized as it allows me to only add what is needed for the desktop version without having to repeat CSS code for each class.

### Continued development

For the future, I plan to refine the solution more when I get the chance.
